dashboard - show memories from memories vaulte - connected (google photos) and create showcase for that like google photos does for us - and show some plans from the planner like today you have a meeting shedules - this is the todo for your today - have you completed - get the most important tasks from goals app and show on desktop dashboard the percentage so that users can brainstorm and which thing to do - create a thougts apps where users can store there thoughts and ideas

also add two things in the dashboard - one a thought of the day and a quote of the day - and a suggestion of the day - like you should do this today (like let's write a poem today and publish on vani) or you should do that today - like a personal assistant


create an app import that will import your other apps data to daksha (photos, calender, forms and others)








in setting add that people can add there custom context about them (that will be prioretised over other journal context) - in a context file - like my name is shaswat raj and i am a software engineer and i am 20 years old - so that daksha can priortise that context over other context

also in the settings add option to add connect other partner that can share.... and parental control
