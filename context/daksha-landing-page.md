## About

Daksha was born out of necessity — a personal quest to build a tool that understands not just *what* we store, but *why* we store it.

Our founder, Shaswat Raj, used to write diaries in a language he invented to keep them private. That same desire for intelligent, personal privacy and reflection drives Daksha today.

Daksha is more than a product — it's a philosophy. We're building a tool that respects your mind and enhances your life.
